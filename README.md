# WB-slide
Wordpress slider plugin based on Bootstrap carousel

# Usage
Basic usage is pretty straightforward - just clone the repo into your plugin directory and use `[wbslide_slider]` shortcode.

# Customization
As of the v0.0.1 you can control only existance of controls in the Wordpress settings menu. More customization needs to be done by CSS - just like you would edit the Bootstrap carousel.
